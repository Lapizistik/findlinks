# Findlinks

A HTML page may contain links/references to other pages/files/images etc.
in various attributes of several elements (a.href, img.src, â€¦).

[`link-elements.yaml`](https://github.com/lapizistik/findlinks/data/link-elements.yaml) provides a
list of HTML elements and attributes which contain URLs (see below) and
may be useful for other languages too.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'findlinks'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install findlinks

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
